# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using Fresh and Markdown. Here's what you can do:

- Write in **Markdown** syntax
- Use code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Organize your content with headers and lists

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component:

```tsx
function HelloWorld() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>This is a React component in a Markdown file.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Features

- **Easy to write** - Just create a new `.md` file in the `content/posts` directory
- **Frontmatter support** - Add metadata like title, date, and excerpt
- **Syntax highlighting** - Code blocks are automatically highlighted
- **Responsive** - Looks great on all devices

Thanks for reading!
